# hyprwrlds

**Worlds** for [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) on [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org): a layer above
workspaces. A world is a block of ten numbered workspaces:

| World | Workspaces |
|---|---|
| A | 1-10 |
| B | 11-20 |
| C | 21-30 |
| ... | ... |
| I | 81-90 |

The current world is simply derived from the focused workspace id, so there is no extra state to
drift. Everything numeric in Hyprland (window rules, `hyprctl`, other tools) keeps working.

Companion project: **[hyprwrlds-vimarchy](https://github.com/angusforbes/hyprwrlds-vimarchy)**, a
Vimarchy-style overview of worlds and workspaces with letter hints, previews and keyboard moves.

## Keys

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| **SUPER+1..0** | **Workspace 1..10 of the current world** |
| SUPER+SHIFT+1..0 | Move window there (follow) |
| SUPER+SHIFT+ALT+1..0 | Move window there silently |
| SUPER+TAB / SUPER+SHIFT+TAB | Next / previous occupied workspace in the current world |
| SUPER+scroll | Cycle occupied workspaces in the current world |
| SUPER+ALT+TAB / SUPER+ALT+SHIFT+TAB | Next / previous world |
| **SUPER+CTRL+1..9** | **Switch to world A..I (lands on that world's last-used workspace)** |
| SUPER+CTRL+SHIFT+1..9 | Move window to world A..I (follow) |
| SUPER+CTRL+ALT+1..9 | Omarchy's "Bar panel N" (moved here from SUPER+CTRL+1..9) |

These replace Omarchy's defaults on the same chords. Notably SUPER+CTRL+1..9 was Omarchy's
"Bar panel N", which now lives on SUPER+CTRL+ALT+1..9; SUPER+ALT+TAB was Omarchy's "next
window in group", and group windows stay reachable with SUPER+ALT+scroll and SUPER+ALT+1..5.

## Bar widget

`omarchy-plugin/agf.hyprwrlds` replaces `omarchy.workspaces` in the top bar: world letters
(A B C ...) followed by the current world's workspace numbers.

- Each world gets a hue from the current Omarchy theme's `colors.toml`
  (A blue, B red, C cyan, D yellow, E magenta, F green, G orange, H brown, I foreground), so it
  follows theme changes.
- The current world is shown as the same solid block as the focused workspace; other worlds show
  their letter, dimmed when empty. The workspace numbers take the current world's colour.
- Click a letter to switch worlds, scroll over the letters to cycle, click a number to go there.
- Setting `worlds` (default 3): how many letters are always shown; higher worlds appear while
  they have windows. `omarchy bar set agf.hyprwrlds worlds 5`

## World-coloured window border

The focused window's border takes the current world's colour (the same theme hues as the bar
widget), updating on every workspace switch and after theme changes. Set `WORLD_BORDERS = false`
at the top of `hyprwrlds.lua` to keep Omarchy's normal border.

## Install

Requires Omarchy with the Quickshell-based `omarchy-shell` and Hyprland 0.56+ (Lua config).

```
git clone https://github.com/angusforbes/hyprwrlds ~/Work/hyprwrlds
~/Work/hyprwrlds/install.sh
```

The script copies `hypr/hyprwrlds.lua` to `~/.config/hypr/`, adds `require("hypr.hyprwrlds")`
after `require("hypr.bindings")` in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`, installs and enables the bar
widget, and swaps it in for `omarchy.workspaces`. Edited files are backed up to
`~/.local/share/hyprwrlds-backups/`. A new bar widget loads without restarting the shell.

`MIN_WORLDS` at the top of `hyprwrlds.lua` (default 5) sets how many worlds SUPER+ALT+TAB cycles
through even when empty; keep it in step with the bar widget's `worlds` setting.

Debug: `hyprctl repl 'return hyprwrlds.state()'`. Scripting: `hyprctl eval 'hyprwrlds.world(2)'`,
`hyprwrlds.focus(n)`, `hyprwrlds.move(n, follow)`, `hyprwrlds.move_to_world(w, follow)`,
`hyprwrlds.cycle_world(±1)`, `hyprwrlds.cycle(±1)`.

## Uninstall

Remove the `require("hypr.hyprwrlds")` line from `hyprland.lua` (Hyprland reloads on save), put
`{"id":"omarchy.workspaces"}` back in place of `{"id":"agf.hyprwrlds"}` in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, and delete `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/agf.hyprwrlds`.

## Notes

- The last-used workspace of each world is remembered in memory only; after a Hyprland config
  reload, switching to a world lands on its lowest occupied workspace instead.
- Window rules that pin an app to workspace `"5"` put it in world A.
- Vimarchy's own workspace-move radial targets absolute workspaces 1-10 (world A).
- If an edit to an already-loaded bar widget doesn't show, the shell may be serving a cached
  copy; restart it with `omarchy-restart-shell`.
